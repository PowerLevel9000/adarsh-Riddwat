        <p id="tribute-info">The existence of the text was revealed in 1952 by G. R. Josyer who asserted that it was written by <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaim%C4%81nika_Sh%C4%81stra" target="_blank">Pandit Subbaraya Shastry</a> (1866–1940), who dictated it during the years 1918–1923. A Hindi translation was published in 1959, while the Sanskrit text with an English translation was published in 1973. It contains 3000 shlokas in 8 chapters which Shastry claimed was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bharadvaja.[3] The text has gained favour among proponents of ancient astronauts. The Vaimānika Śāstra manuscript appeared at Rajakiya Sanskrit Library, Baroda by 1944.[4] The text was published in Hindi in 1959[5] and later in English by G.R. Josyer, titled Vymanika Shastra.[6] Josyer's edition also added illustrations drawn by T. K. Ellappa, a draughtsman at a local engineering college in Bangalore, under the direction of Shastry, which had been missed in the 1959 edition.[7]</p>
